      <description>With the COVID-19 pandemic still affecting summer travel and leisure, the Fur Trade Days, Inc. board would like to remind everyone that there are no officially organized Fur Trade Days events for 2020. In consideration of the economic hardship local businesses and families are going through, Fur Trade Days, Inc. is not seeking donations or sponsorships this year. If any business has been solicited for a donation supporting events on July 9-12, please be aware that it was not on behalf of Fur Trade Days, Inc.</description>
